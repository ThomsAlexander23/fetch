Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Software Engineering - Mobile

A native Android app in Java that retrieves the data from https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json.
utilizing Retrofit library to handle the request.

it displays the data in the form of an expandable list that condenses into ListIds and expands out the itemNames 
and adheres to the following restrictions:

Display all the items grouped by "listId"
Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.

I have also added a button that initially generates the request on click event tied to to it as well as 
made use of Toasts for what could be potential features in this particular scenario. 

Overall, this being both my first coding challenge/evaluation and first dive into android through Java it
has been a rewarding and informative experience.
